Do Not Hack
===========

Do Not Hack is an integral part of the Hackspace. Do Not Hack means you are claiming materials, a donation or a project as your own, and requesting that no other members 'hack' the component parts.

Do Not Hack means you are taking responsibility for the materials et al, and will remove them from the Space if required.

Do Not Hack is not a guarantee your project will not be touched, moved or repatriated. It is simply our best attempt at securing your project. If you leave a project or materials in the space and they are not stored appropriately or safely, your project will be moved.

Do Not Hack labels **must** be generated using `Hackspace Management System (HMS) <https://hms.nottinghack.org.uk>`_ and printed using the label printer on the large project storage in the studio. More information about this can be found in the `Members guide <https://guide.nottinghack.org.uk/do-not-hack.html#generating-a-label>`_.

If there is an issue with the label printer, please contact trustees@nottinghack.org.uk. There will be some leeway on handwritten labels if you have notified us of an issue accessing HMS or using the label printer. Handwritten labels must include your full name, your HMS username, and the date.

**Infrastructure and tools** may be labelled and shouldnâ€™t be hacked.

When a project is left unlabelled, the Trustees or other members may note this, and **mark it as unlabelled**. If something remains unlabelled for more than a month, it will be disposed of or reused..
