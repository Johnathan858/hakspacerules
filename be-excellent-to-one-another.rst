Be Excellent To One Another
===========================

We ask that you respect others when using the Space. Do this by **cleaning up after yourself** and abiding by our **safe spaces** policy in Appendix B. We encourage members to challenge other members if they notice they are leaving without cleaning up after themselves.

There are housekeeping tasks that always need doing, and can be completed by most members. These include tasks such as emptying bins, turning on the dishwasher, and turning off the lights when you leave. Please see this `Chores <https://wiki.nottinghack.org.uk/wiki/Reoccurring_tasks>`_ page on our Wiki for more information.

Ensure that you are aware of our **complaints policy** (Appendix A).

Remember that Nottingham Hackspace is run by the volunteers for the members, and we ask that you be a **member not a consumer**. Donâ€™t be a greedy hacker.
