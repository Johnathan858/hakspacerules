Membership of the Hackspace
===========================

Any person of the age of 18 or over can join Nottingham Hackspace, by visiting on a tour on Wednesday evening, providing correct details and setting up and maintaining a monthly payment into our nominated bank account.

The amount you pay into Nottingham Hackspace is your own choice, however this should be more than you cost the hackspace. There is a fixed minimum of £5 - amounts less than this will be treated as a donation. For information **the average costs per hour to run the Hackspace can be seen on our** `Cost of hacking page <http://nottinghack.org.uk/tools/costposter/>`_ .

From time to time all membership contributions will be reviewed and members may be asked to increase their contribution.

Should you bring guests to the Space regularly, please **ensure your membership fees cover their access** and usage of the Hackspace.

When a member stops paying their standing order, they will become an Ex-Member. **An ex member will be provided notification of such**, and **their members box and any project will be relocated** within 2 months of the last standing order payment. Nottingham Hackspace will abide by the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977 when disposing of any ex-member's possessions.

If you decide to no longer be a member, please take your box away with you, or empty your member's box and remove any other possessions first.

**Members must follow and agree to all rules**, and membership may be revoked through the complaints policy.

Nottingham Hackspace is required under Companies Act [#]_ to keep a record of the name, and current address of each member. We use the HMS (Hackspace Members System) website [#]_ to keep this information, it is very important that you keep this up-to-date, including your full legal name, email address [#]_ for contact purposes.
